A single TaskChain activity consists of an optional entry page, a chain of tasks and an optional exit page. Each task may be a static web page or an interactive web page which offers students text, audio and visual prompts and records their responses. The tasks are created on the teacher\'s computer using authoring software and then uploaded to Moodle.

The teacher can define learning paths through a chain by adding pre-conditions and post-conditions to the tasks. A task cannot be attempted until all the pre-conditions have been satisfied. After the task is finished, the post-conditions define what is displayed next to the student.

A TaskChain activity can contain tasks created with the following authoring software:
