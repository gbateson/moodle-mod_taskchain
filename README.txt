Credits
===============================================

    Many thanks to all the users of this module for the feedback over the years.

    In particular, I am very grateful to my erstwhile colleague Wes Cunningham,
    whose help, feedback and ideas have been invaluable during the development of
    the TaskChain module and its predecessor the QuizPort module (for Moodle 1.x).

    I am also very grateful for the recognition and support that this software
    has received from the Moodle Association of Japan (MAJ). Arigatō gozaimashita!
